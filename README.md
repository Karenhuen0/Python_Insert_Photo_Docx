According to the reference link, I have modified the table cell. In addition, it can support photo file name with different characters such as chinese.

Step:
1. Run "insert_file.exe" application.
2. Select Folder which includes a photo that you would like to insert into a document.
3. Find your doc file according to your selected folder path.
